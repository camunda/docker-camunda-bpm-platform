> Use our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/issues) for bug reports or feature requests.
> For help requests, open a help request topic on the [Camunda forum](https://forum.camunda.org/) or [a help request support ticket](https://docs.camunda.org/enterprise/support/#how-to-create-a-support-issue) if you are an enterprise customer.

This Camunda project provides docker images of the latest 
Camunda Platform releases. The images can be used to demonstrate and test the
Camunda Platform or can be extended with own process applications. It is
planned to provide images on the official [docker registry][] for every upcoming
release, which includes alpha releases.

The Camunda Platform Docker images are wrappers for the pre-packaged Camunda
distributions. The pre-packaged distributions are intended for users who want a 
getting started experience. In case you want to use the Camunda Docker images 
in production, consider reading our [security instructions](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/security/).

## Distributions

You can find more detailed documentation on the pre-packaged (community) 
distributions that Camunda provides at the following links:

* Apache Tomcat - [Camunda Tomcat integration documentation](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/runtime-container-integration/tomcat/)
* Wildfly - [Camunda Wildfly Subsystem documentation](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/runtime-container-integration/jboss/)
* Camunda Platform Run - [documentation](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/camunda-bpm-run/)

## Get started

To start a Docker container of the latest Camunda Platform 7 release:

```
docker pull camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest
docker run -d --name camunda -p 8080:8080 camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest
```

### Tasklist, Cockpit, Admin web apps

The three Camunda web apps are accessible through the landing page: 
http://localhost:8080/camunda-welcome/index.html

The default credentials for admin access to the web apps is:

- Username: `demo`
- Password: `demo`

### REST API

The Camunda Rest-API is accessible through: http://localhost:8080/engine-rest

See the [REST API](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/rest/)
documentation for more details on how to use it.

**Note**: The REST API does not require authentication by default. Follow the instructions from the [documentation](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/rest/overview/authentication/)
to enable authentication for the REST API.

## Supported tags/releases

The following tag schema is used. The user has the choice between different
application server distributions of Camunda Platform.

- `latest`, `${DISTRO}-latest`: Always the latest minor release of Camunda Platform.
- `SNAPSHOT`, `${VERSION}-SNAPSHOT`, `${DISTRO}-SNAPSHOT`,
  `${DISTRO}-${VERSION}-SNAPSHOT`: The latest SNAPSHOT version of Camunda 
  Platform, which is not released yet.
- `${VERSION}`, `${DISTRO}-${VERSION}`: A specific version of Camunda Platform.

`${DISTRO}` can be one of the following: 
* `tomcat`
* `wildfly`
* `run`

If no `${DISTRO}` is specified, the `tomcat` distribution is used. For all 
available tags see the [docker hub tags][].

## Camunda Platform 7 configuration

You can find the complete Camunda documentation at https://docs.camunda.org/.

If you prefer to start your Camunda Docker image right away, you will find the
following links useful:

* [Camunda Platform configuration file properties](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/deployment-descriptors/descriptors/bpm-platform-xml/)
* [Process Engine Plugins guide](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/process-engine-plugins/)
* [Camunda Logging](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/logging/)

## Camunda Docker image configuration

### Configuration of the `run` distribution

Because `run` is a Spring Boot-based distribution, it can be configured through 
the respective environment variables. For example:
- `SPRING_DATASOURCE_DRIVER_CLASS_NAME` the database driver class name, 
  supported are h2 (default), mysql, and postgresql:
  - h2: `DB_DRIVER=org.h2.Driver`
  - mysql: `DB_DRIVER=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver`
  - postgresql: `DB_DRIVER=org.postgresql.Driver`
- `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` the database jdbc url
- `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME` the database username
- `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` the database password

When not set or otherwise specified, the integrated H2 database is used.

Any other `SPRING_*` variables can be used to further configure the app. 
Alternatively, a `default.yml` file can be mounted to `/camunda/configuration/default.yml`.
More information on configuring Spring Boot applications can be found in the 
[Spring Boot documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config).

The following environment variables are supported for convenience and 
compatibility and are internally mapped to `SPRING_DATASOURCE_*` variables 
when provided:

* `DB_DRIVER`
* `DB_USERNAME`
* `DB_PASSWORD`
* `DB_URL`
* `DB_PASSWORD_FILE`

The `JMX_PROMETHEUS` configuration is not supported, and while `DEBUG` can be 
used to enable debug output, it doesn't start a debug socket.

`run` supports different startup options to choose whether or not to enable the 
WebApps, the REST API or Swagger UI. By default, all three are enabled.

Passing startup parameters to enable them selectively can be done by passing any 
combination of `--webapps`, `--rest` or `--swaggerui` like in the following 
example:

Enable only web apps:

```bash
docker run camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:run ./camunda.sh --webapps
``` 
Enable only REST API and Swagger UI:
```bash
docker run camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:run ./camunda.sh --rest --swaggerui
```

Additionally, a `--production` parameter is supported to switch the 
configuration to `/camunda/configuration/production.yml`. This parameter also 
disables Swagger UI by default.

### Java versions

Our docker images are using the latest LTS OpenJDK version supported by
Camunda Platform. This currently means:

 - Camunda 7.20 or later will be based on OpenJDK 17.
   - Camunda 7.20 image for Camunda Run is supported only for JDK 17.
 - Camunda 7.12 - 7.19 is based on OpenJDK 11.
   - Camunda 7.19 image for WildFly is supported only for JDK 11 and JDK 17.
 - All previous versions are based on OpenJDK 8.

While all the OpenJDK versions supported by Camunda will work with the exceptions specified above,
we will not provide ready to use images for them.

#### Java options

To override the default Java options the environment variable `JAVA_OPTS` can
be set.

### Use docker memory limits

Instead of specifying the Java memory settings it is also possible to instruct
the JVM to respect the docker memory settings. As the image uses Java 17 it does
not have to be enabled explicitly using the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable. 
If you want to set the memory limits manually you can restore the pre-Java-11-behavior
by setting the following environment variable.

```
JAVA_OPTS="-XX:-UseContainerSupport"
```

### Database environment variables

The used database can be configured by providing the following environment
variables:

- `DB_CONN_MAXACTIVE` the maximum number of active connections (default: `20`)
- `DB_CONN_MAXIDLE` the maximum number of idle connections (default: `20`)
  - ignored when app server = `wildfly` or `run`
- `DB_CONN_MINIDLE` the minimum number of idle connections (default: `5`)
- `DB_DRIVER` the database driver class name, supported are h2, mysql, and postgresql:
  - h2: `DB_DRIVER=org.h2.Driver`
  - mysql: `DB_DRIVER=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver`
  - postgresql: `DB_DRIVER=org.postgresql.Driver`
- `DB_URL` the database jdbc url
- `DB_USERNAME` the database username
- `DB_PASSWORD` the database password
- `DB_VALIDATE_ON_BORROW` validate database connections before they are used (default: `false`)
- `DB_VALIDATION_QUERY` the query to execute to validate database connections (default: `"SELECT 1"`)
- `DB_PASSWORD_FILE` this supports [Docker Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/). 
  Put here the path of the secret, e.g. `/run/secrets/camunda_db_password`. 
  Make sure that `DB_PASSWORD` is not set when using this variable!
- `SKIP_DB_CONFIG` skips the automated database configuration to use manual
  configuration
- `WAIT_FOR` wait for a `host:port` to be available over TCP before starting
- `WAIT_FOR_TIMEOUT` how long to wait for the service to be avaiable - defaults to 30 seconds

For example, to use a `postgresql` docker image as database you can start the
platform as follows:

```
# start postgresql image with database and user configured
docker run -d --name postgresql ...

docker run -d --name camunda -p 8080:8080 --link postgresql:db \
           -e DB_DRIVER=org.postgresql.Driver \
           -e DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/process-engine \
           -e DB_USERNAME=camunda \
           -e DB_PASSWORD=camunda \
           -e WAIT_FOR=db:5432 \
           camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest
```

Another option is to save the database config to an environment file, i.e.
`db-env.txt`:

```
DB_DRIVER=org.postgresql.Driver
DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/process-engine
DB_USERNAME=camunda
DB_PASSWORD=camunda
WAIT_FOR=db:5432
```

Use this file to start the container:

```
docker run -d --name camunda -p 8080:8080 --link postgresql:db \
           --env-file db-env.txt camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest
```

The docker image already contains drivers for `h2`, `mysql`, and `postgresql`.
If you want to use other databases, you have to add the driver to the container
and configure the database settings manually by linking the configuration file
into the container.

To skip the configuration of the database by the docker container and use your
own configuration set the environment variable `SKIP_DB_CONFIG` to a non-empty 
value:

```
docker run -d --name camunda -p 8080:8080 -e SKIP_DB_CONFIG=true \
           camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest
```

### Waiting for database

Starting the Camunda Platform Docker image requires the database to be already 
available. This is quite a challenge when the database and Camunda Platform are 
both docker containers spawned simultaneously, for example, by `docker-compose` 
or inside a Kubernetes Pod. To help with that, the Camunda Platform Docker image 
includes [wait-for-it.sh](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it) to allow the 
container to wait until a 'host:port' is ready. The mechanism can be configured 
by two environment variables:

- `WAIT_FOR`: the service `host:port` to wait for
- `WAIT_FOR_TIMEOUT`: how long to wait for the service to be available in seconds

Example with a PostgreSQL container:

```
docker run -d --name postgresql ...

docker run -d --name camunda -p 8080:8080 --link postgresql:db \
           -e DB_DRIVER=org.postgresql.Driver \
           -e DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/process-engine \
           -e DB_USERNAME=camunda \
           -e DB_PASSWORD=camunda \
           -e WAIT_FOR=db:5432 \
           -e WAIT_FOR_TIMEOUT=60 \
           camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest
```

### Volumes

Camunda Platform is installed inside the `/camunda` directory. Which
means the Apache Tomcat configuration files are inside the `/camunda/conf/` 
directory and the deployments on Apache Tomcat are in `/camunda/webapps/`. 
The directory structure depends on the application server.

### Debug

To enable JPDA inside the container, you can set the environment variable
`DEBUG=true` on startup of the container. This will allow you to connect to the
container on port `8000` to debug your application.
This is only supported for `wildfly` and `tomcat` distributions.

### Prometheus JMX Exporter

To enable Prometheus JMX Exporter inside the container, you can set the 
environment variable `JMX_PROMETHEUS=true` on startup of the container. 
This will allow you to get metrics in Prometheus format at `<host>:9404/metrics`. 
For configuring exporter you need attach your configuration as a container volume 
at `/camunda/javaagent/prometheus-jmx.yml`. This is only supported for `wildfly` 
and `tomcat` distributions.

### Change timezone

To change the timezone of the docker container, you can set the environment
variable `TZ`.

```
docker run -d --name camunda -p 8080:8080 \
           -e TZ=Europe/Berlin \
          camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest
```

## Build

You can build a Docker image for a given Camunda Platform version and distribution yourself.
If you want to build the community edition (CE), make sure to adjust the 
[settings.xml](settings.xml)
and remove the `camunda-nexus` mirror.
If you want to build the enterprise edition (EE), check out [the dedicated README section](#build-an-enterprise-version).

### Build a released version

To build a community image specify the `DISTRO` and `VERSION` build
argument. Possible values for `DISTRO` are:
* `tomcat`
* `wildfly`
* `run` (if the Camunda Platform version already supports it)

The `VERSION` argument is the Camunda Platform version you want to build, 
i.e. `7.17.0`.

```
docker build -t camunda-bpm-platform \
  --build-arg DISTRO=${DISTRO} \
  --build-arg VERSION=${VERSION} \
  .
```

### Build a SNAPSHOT version

Additionally, you can build `SNAPSHOT` versions for the upcoming releases by
setting the `SNAPSHOT` build argument to `true`.

```
docker build -t camunda-bpm-platform \
  --build-arg DISTRO=${DISTRO} \
  --build-arg VERSION=${VERSION} \
  --build-arg SNAPSHOT=true \
  .
```

### Build an enterprise version

If you are a Camunda enterprise customer, you can build
an enterprise version of the Docker image. Set the `VERSION`
build argument to the Camunda version without the ee suffix, i.e. `7.16.1`,
set the `EE` build argument to `true` and
the `USER` and `PASSWORD` build argument to your enterprise credentials.

It is recommended that you `git checkout` the branch for the Camunda version
you would like to build. For example, if you want to build a Docker image for
Camunda version `7.16.3`, first execute `git checkout 7.16` on this repository. 

**Note:** As the image uses a multi-stage Dockerfile the credentials are
**not** part of the Docker image history of the final image. Be
aware that you should not distribute this image outside your company.

```
docker build -t camunda-bpm-platform \
  --build-arg EE=true \
  --build-arg DISTRO=${DISTRO} \
  --build-arg VERSION=${VERSION} \
  --build-arg USER=${USER} \
  --build-arg PASSWORD=${PASSWORD} \
  .
```

### Build when behind a proxy

You can pass the following arguments to set proxy settings to Maven: 

* `MAVEN_PROXY_HOST`
* `MAVEN_PROXY_PORT`
* `MAVEN_PROXY_USER`
* `MAVEN_PROXY_PASSWORD`

Example for a released version of a community edition:

```
docker build -t camunda-bpm-platform \
  --build-arg DISTRO=${DISTRO} \
  --build-arg VERSION=${VERSION} \
  --build-arg MAVEN_PROXY_HOST=${PROXY_HOST} \
  --build-arg MAVEN_PROXY_PORT=${PROXY_PORT} \
  --build-arg MAVEN_PROXY_USER=${PROXY_USER} \
  --build-arg MAVEN_PROXY_PASSWORD=${PROXY_PASSWORD} \
  .
```

## Use cases

### Change configuration files

You can use docker volumes to link your own configuration files inside the
container.  For example, if you want to change the `bpm-platform.xml` on 
Apache Tomcat:

```
docker run -d --name camunda -p 8080:8080 \
           -v $PWD/bpm-platform.xml:/camunda/conf/bpm-platform.xml \
           camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest
```

### Add own process application

If you want to add your own process application to the docker container, you can
use Docker volumes. For example, if you want to deploy the [twitter demo][] 
on Apache Tomcat:

```
docker run -d --name camunda -p 8080:8080 \
           -v /PATH/TO/DEMO/twitter.war:/camunda/webapps/twitter.war \
           camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest
```

This also allows you to modify the app outside the container, and it will
be redeployed inside the platform.


### Clean distro without web apps and examples

To remove all web apps and examples from the distro and only deploy your
own applications or your own configured cockpit also use Docker volumes. You
only have to overlay the deployment folder of the application server with
a directory on your local machine. So in Apache Tomcat, you would mount a 
directory to `/camunda/webapps/`:

```
docker run -d --name camunda -p 8080:8080 \
           -v $PWD/webapps/:/camunda/webapps/ \
           camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest
```


## Extend Docker image

As we release these docker images on the official [docker registry][] it is
easy to create your own image. This way you can deploy your applications
with docker or provided an own demo image. Just specify in the `FROM`
clause which Camunda image you want to use as a base image:

```
FROM camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:tomcat-latest

ADD my.war /camunda/webapps/my.war
```

## Branching model

Branches and their roles in this repository:

- `next` (default branch) is the branch where new features and bugfixes needed 
  to support the current `master` of [camunda-bpm-platform repo](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform) go.
- `7.x` branches get created from `next` when a Camunda Platform minor version
  is released. They only receive backports of bugfixes when absolutely necessary.
